# [Faucets - Crypto link testing web app](https://w-business-549e4.web.app/)

## What is done by me for this task?
1. I Cloned **[This site](https://faucets.netlify.app/)**
2. I changed the color but **can't drastic change** like theme or pattern. 
3. I implicate **Context API** for useing state from nav to the body. (I avoid redux because this is a very small design and the state management are not so complicated. Also maybe it can take more time to setup and use than context api for me)
4. I **Validated** login and signup form using **react-hook-form**
5. Create FAQ page where I used accordion (bootastrap components)
6. I also use **React-router-dom** for routing
7. Also **added recaptcha** which is working perfectly.

## Hosting
1. I host this project on **firebase**
2. Push source code Github
